# Doofus' Pulpit Adventures by Muktikanta Dash

Hi, I'm Muktikanta Dash from VIT Chennai. This project has been made as part of an Assignment on Unity3D for HitWicket's Game Developer Role.

The Following are the details about the project -

Doofus likes to walk on Pulpits - magical platforms that appear and disappear at random intervals of time. If he falls, the game ends. 
We have to try to make Doofus walk on as many pulpits as possible.

 - In My iteration of the game, I decided to give Doofus a little bit of a personality, by replacing the usual cube with a Capsule with Glowing Rectangular Sunglasses
 Reminiscent of AmongUs characters.
